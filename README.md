## About
COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease) has recently caused a global pandemic resulting in over 700,000 infected and more than 30,000 deaths worldwide. As this situation poses a serious public health risk to anyone and everyone, the federal government including the public health department (nurses, doctors) has been working nonstop to help treat and care for the infected. To assist in this battle for survival, the coronavirus recovery calculator has been created to accurately predict survival rates and give patients a sense of reassurance.
